The Netflix Userbase dataset serves as a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data. It can be used for analysis and modeling to understand user trends, preferences, and revenue generation within a hypothetical Netflix userbase. The objective of the analysis is aimed at understanding user behavior, preferences, and subscription patterns.
